# Neo4jClient.DataAnnotations
Use POCO classes in the Neo4jClient library ORM style. Annotate with System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema attributes. Supports Complex Types too. 

Still in progress. In the meantime, while I prepare proper documentation for this, you can head over to my [Neo4j.AspNetCore.Identity](https://github.com/francnuec/Neo4j.AspNetCore.Identity) project to see how this library is used. Check the identity sample for integration hints.

Get it on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Neo4jClient.DataAnnotations/1.0.1-beta).

All issues are welcomed. :)
